# python-Practice

This repository contains 4 folders:

1. Python_For_Everybody: This folder contains the basics of python starting with creating a variable, manipulating string data, mathametical operators and use of inbuilt methods

2. Python_Datastructures: Contains programs which use pythong data structures such as lists, dictionaries and tuples

3. Python_DataMunging: This Contains work books with code deployed using loops, datastructures using loops, basic use of packages such as NumPy, Pandas, matplotlib and ScikitLearn, classification algorithms, regression models, basics of tensorflow,  neural networks and creationg of visualizations using aforementioned packages.

4. MachineLearning_Practice: This contains work books various machine learning Models using Python. Packages originally used in Python_DataMunging folder have been used at an advanced level to create machine learning models such as regression, decision tree, clustering, time series analysis and use of various efficiency measures to test the quality of the model deployed using datasets from open source libraries such as Kaggle, ChEMBL.
